It has been common in recent years to see commentary that a consequence of nuclear power plant closure is increased electricity generation by fossil-fuel buring power plants.  Examples include the 2021 shut-down of [Indian Point](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/12/nyregion/indian-point-power-plant-closing.html) in New York State, and the 2023 closure of Germany's [final three nuclear plants](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend) which left the country's generation footprint as being among the most [carbon-intensive](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/05/10/germany-end-nuclear-cost-climate-health/) in Europe.

This article explores the impact on fossil-fuel burning electricity generation around a similar natural experiment in the other direction: the activation of the Vogtle 3 nuclear power plant in the U.S. state of Georgia on July 31, 2023.  

I draw on data from the U.S. region where the grid is operated by Southern Company (most of Alabama and Georgia and smaller parts of Misssissippi and Florida).  Beginning with the noisy picture of how much power is generated daily by each nuclear plant in the region, I build to the smoother picture of how much electricity is generated by the region's plants (both before and after Vogtle 3 came online).  

I then examine the overall electricity generation profile of the region in comparable months over several years (attempting to control for different demand profiles in different seasons), to estimate the carbon impact of the new Vogtle plant.

### A Picture of One Region's Nuclear Supply

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission provides [daily reports](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/event-status/reactor-status/index.html) of the level of power output of each nuclear power plant in the U.S.  For a small case study,
