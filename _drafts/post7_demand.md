In this post I return to the structure of electricity pricing in the U.S., this time focusing on a pricing concept that is mandatory for business customers that 
exceed a certain size (measured in monthly electricity consumption): **Demand Pricing.**  Under a demand pricing scheme, an electricity customer is charged in two separate ways: 

(1) First, electricity consumption.  This is the concept described in [earlier](https://jgkramer.github.io/2022/10/15/Residential-Electricity-Rates.html) [posts](https://jgkramer.github.io/2022/11/07/Electricity_Usage_Anecdotes.html) -- the total energy consumption, measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh), during a month is measured, and a per-kWh rate is applied.   The per-kWh charge may depend on the season and time of day (as in a Time of Use Plan), or it may be fixed.  

(2) Second, electricity "demand."
