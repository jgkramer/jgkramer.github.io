Electricity demand in the U.S. has had near-zero growth for the last several decades.  According to a [Goldman Sachs report](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/generational-growth-ai-data-centers-and-the-coming-us-power-surge/report.pdf), "US annual power generation over the past 20 years averag[ed] less than 0.5% growth."  In recent months, a number of [utility reports](https://insidelines.pjm.com/pjm-publishes-2024-long-term-load-forecast/) and [media sources](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/how-big-data-centers-are-slowing-the-shift-to-clean-energy-44ef4145) have proclaimed a shift towards resumed electricity growth, feuled by a growth in data center installations (especially driven by data-intensive AI applications), along with other electrification initatives including electric vehicles and electric heating.
