In this post, I will review a couple of usage patterns of electricity -- a family 

## Usage

Here are some images. 

### Summer

August in Nevada is hot, both in high temperatures (many days over 100&deg;F) and low temperatures (many over 80&deg;F), meaning air conditioning 
tends to run 24 hours a day, although most frequently in the afternoon and early evening when the temperature is highest.  The below is a chart of 
my family's electricity usage in 15 minute increments (provided by NV Energy's website).
