In this post, I will review a couple of usage patterns of electricity -- a family 

## Usage

The below are a series of charts of my family's electricity usage in 15 minute increments (provided by NV Energy's website).  

#### Winter
Winter electricity usage is modest -- temperatures are chilly but our heating is natural-gas powered.  Thus the **64 kWh** consumption from 
3-Feb is more or less our baseline usage from lights and appliances for a family of four.   The **25 kWh** uptick on Tuesday 1-Feb is the impact of 
our once-a-week laundry day: our electric dryer requirements are 26A x 240V = ~6 kW maximum, so running it for 5-6 hours with some breaks and some low
power times (e.g., cool down) seems to approximately account for the 25 kWh.

#### Summer
August in Nevada is hot, both in high temperatures (many days over 100&deg;F) and low temperatures (many over 80&deg;F), meaning air conditioning 
tends to run most of the day and night.  This brings the total electricity usage to **2.0 to 2.5x** the winter baseline usage.

Electricity consumption is sensitive to temperatures: 164 kWh on the 109&deg; day vs. 131 on the 96&deg; day, with the majority of the increase 
coming from peak hours.  Our family keeps the house 4&deg; cooler at night, so the general pattern is moderate usage at night when it is not as hot, 
to maintain the cooler temperatures; **lower** usage in the late morning as we let the house warm up a bit during the day; and **much higher** usage 
in the late afternoon / evening as the house warms up and weather is hottest.

#### Spring
