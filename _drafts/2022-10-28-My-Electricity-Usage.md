The last post's foray into electricity rates, especially Time-Of-Use (TOU) plans, inspired me to inquire about my own electricity usage patterns 
in the Las Vegas area.  First, I will build some intuition about patterns of use by time of day by visualizing my smart-meter outputs (provided by 
NVEnergy's website) on a handful of days across different seasons.   I will then step back and look at total consumption across an entire year. 

## A Sampling of Usage Data

#### Winter
Winter electricity usage is modest -- temperatures are chilly but our heating is natural-gas powered (this uses a little bit of electricity, generating
the day-long squiggles, but not too much).  Thus the **64 kWh** consumption from 3-Feb is about our baseline usage from lights and appliances.
The **25 kWh** incresae on Tuesday 1-Feb is the impact of our once-a-week laundry day: our electric dryer is rated 26A x 240V = ~6 kW maximum, 
so running it for 5-6 hours with some breaks and some low power times (e.g., cool down) seems to approximately account for the 25 kWh.

#### Summer
August in Nevada is hot, both in high temperatures (many days over 100&deg;F) and low temperatures (many over 80&deg;F), meaning air conditioning 
tends to run most of the day and night.  This brings the total electricity usage to **2.0 to 2.5x** the winter baseline usage.

Electricity consumption is sensitive to temperatures: 164 kWh on the 109&deg; day vs. 131 on the 96&deg; day, with the majority of the increase 
coming from peak hours.  Our family keeps the house 4&deg; cooler at night, so the general pattern is moderate usage at night when it is not as hot, 
to maintain the cooler temperatures; **lower** usage in the late morning as we let the house warm up a bit during the day; and **much higher** usage 
in the late afternoon / evening as the house warms up and weather is hottest.

#### Spring
