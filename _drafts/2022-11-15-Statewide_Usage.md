This post explores the seasonality of my electricity usage (big peak in the summer) in the Las Vegas area and whether it scales macroscopically 
to the entire state.  I then explore how seasonality varies from one place to another across the country, making use of both anecdotal individual 
homeowner data I have collected, as well as state-wide data.

Of particular use is material published by the U.S. Energy Information Agency with data sets breaking down electricity consumption
by [state, month and sector](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data.php#sales) for 30+ years.  

The following chart shows the seasonality of Nevada statewide electricity usage in TeraWatt-hours (1 billion kWh), averaged over the 36 month period 
Sep. 2019 to Aug. 2022:
