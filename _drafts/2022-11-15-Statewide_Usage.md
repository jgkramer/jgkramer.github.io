This post explores the seasonality of my electricity usage (big peak in the summer) in the Las Vegas area and whether it scales macroscopically 
to the entire state.  I then explore how seasonality varies from one place to another across the country, making use of both anecdotal individual 
homeowner data I have collected, as well as state-wide data.

The following chart shows the seasonality of Nevada statewide electricity usage in TeraWatt-hours (1 billion kWh), averaged over the 36 month period 
Sep. 2019 to Aug. 2022.  This and similar statewide data is derived from data sets on the U.S. Energy Information Agency website breaking down energy 
consumption by [state, month and sector](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data.php#sales).

Several lessons from this data: 

* Residential total use of 14.1 TWh (14.1 billion kWh) per year for 3.1 million Nevada residents    
  - Average of 4,562 kWh per year per Nevada resident.  
  - My family-of-four total of 30,300 kWh for a year was 6.6x the per capita usage, not too surprising for a larger-than-average single-family home in the suburbs 
* Significant seasonality of residential usage, most prominently a big summer air-conditioning peak
  - Of the 14.1 TWh annual usage, 49.8% occurs during the four months June through September
  - Peak usage month (July) is 2.63x the minimum usage month (November)
* There is a small winter peak, perhaps driven by a combination of heating and more lighting / appliance usage with shorter days
  - Peak winter usage month (December) is 1.24x the minimum usage month
