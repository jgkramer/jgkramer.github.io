This post explores the seasonality of electricity usage at both the individual level (e.g., my own) and how it scales to the macro level
(e.g., state-wide in Nevada).  I then explore how seasonality varies from one place to another across the country, making use of both anecdotal 
individual homeowner data I have collected, as well as state-wide data.

### Nevada

The following chart shows Nevada's monthly consumption throughout the year in TeraWatt-hours (1 billion kWh), averaged over the 3 year period 
Sep. 2019 to Aug. 2022.  This and similar statewide data is derived from data sets on the U.S. Energy Information Agency website breaking down energy 
consumption by [state, month and sector](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data.php#sales).

Several observations: 

* Residential total use of 14.1 TWh (14.1 billion kWh) per year for 3.1 million Nevada residents    
  - Average of 4,500 kWh per year per Nevada resident.  
  - My family-of-four total of 30,000 kWh for a year was 6.6x the per capita usage, not surprising for a larger-than-average single-family suburban home
* Heavy seasonality of residential usage, most prominently a big summer air-conditioning peak
  - Of the 14.1 TWh annual usage, 49.8% occurs during the four months June through September
  - Peak usage month (July) is 2.63x the minimum usage month (November)
* There is a small winter peak, perhaps driven by a combination of heating and more lighting / appliance usage with shorter daylight hours
  - Peak winter usage month (December) is 1.24x the minimum usage month

Note that the TOTAL state electricity usage has less seasonality than the residential sector: the summer peak is 1.8x the minimum usage month, and the 
winter peak is 1.1x.  Highly variable climate control electric usage is presumably lower for the commercial and industrial sectors than for residences.

I then compare statewide usage to my own, showing the percentage of annual consumption in each month of the year.  The individual usage throughout the 
year very closely matches the profile of aggregate month-to-month residential use (commercial and industrial use is visibly less seasonal).[^1] 

[^1]: In the dark blue series, the artificially-low consumption in June-July due to travel has been replaced by (1) July being assumed to be the same as 
August and (2) June being halfway between May and August.

### Northern Climates

Next up, a colder climate: Connecticut in the U.S. Northeast.  Average July high temperatures in New Haven, Connecticut: 86&deg;F (Las Vegas: 107&deg;F); 
average January high temperatures: 37&deg;F (Las Vegas: 59&deg;F).
