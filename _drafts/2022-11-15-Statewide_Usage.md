This post explores the seasonality of my electricity usage (big peak in the summer) in the Las Vegas area and whether it scales macroscopically 
to the entire state.  I then explore how seasonality varies from one place to another across the country, making use of both anecdotal individual 
homeowner data I have collected, as well as state-wide data.

The following chart shows the seasonality of Nevada statewide electricity usage in TeraWatt-hours (1 billion kWh), averaged over the 36 month period 
Sep. 2019 to Aug. 2022.  This and similar statewide data is derived from data sets on the U.S. Energy Information Agency website breaking down energy 
consumption by [state, month and sector](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data.php#sales).
