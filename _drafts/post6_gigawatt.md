I sometimes find it frustrating as an observer of energy markets and policy to understand the quantities those markets deal in.  News and commentators quote prices in units that consumers may be unfamiliar with, making it difficult to intuit the importance of those prices.  Here are some examples: 

- **War in Ukraine**  European wholesale natural gas prices (Dutch Title Transfer Facility or Dutch TTF) ran from &euro;88 per MegaWatt hour (MWh) in February 2022 before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, to a peak of &euro;340 per MWh in August 2022 when concerns about a shortage ran highest.   After conservation efforts, European countries securing liquefied natural gas imports, and a warmer-than-feared winter, prices fell back to [&euro;76](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/business/europe-natural-gas-prices.html) [or lower](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sliding-natural-gas-prices-deal-surprise-reprieve-to-europe-11673005590) by the start of 2023.  In 2020, these prices were under &euro;20 per MWh.

- **U.S. Natural Gas Prices**.  Quoted in MMBTU (million british thermal units).  Often are in the $2 - 3 range, but driven by Ukraine-driven supply shocks, [briefly exceeded $9](https://www.wsj.com/articles/natural-gas-prices-plunge-and-drillers-dial-back-236a2a9).  In California, however, a pipeline closure limited supply and prices averaged [$19.40 per MMBTU in early January](https://www.wsj.com/articles/natural-gas-prices-have-fallen-back-to-earthexcept-in-california-11673411627) while the Henry Hub benchmark was under $4.00.  With different units, 

- **Cost of U.S. Nuclear**.  In 2019, the State of Connecticut and the owner of the Millstone nuclear power plant in Waterbury, CT reached a 10-year agreement in which the state's utilities would agree to purchase up to 50% of the plant's electricity generation at a price of [$49.99 per MWh](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/pdf/2020-R-0203.pdf); the deal at the time was criticized as potentially increasing electricity costs given the low prices of natural gas.  At the time, natural gas prices in connecticut for were in the range of [$3 - $5 per thousand cubic feet](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n3045ct3m.htm).  How much additional expense per MWh of electricity did this appear to incur at the time and what kinds of natural gas prices reflected a more breakeven level? 

- **French Nuclear Power** After experiencing major maintenance issues earlier in the year, it was reported in December 2022 with significant relief that the French nuclear power plant fleet was generating above 40 GW of electricity for the [first time in 9 months](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/french-nuclear-production-surpasses-40-gw-grid-operator-2022-12-11/)

- **Wholesale electricity**  In February 2023, New England faced a cold snap that saw next-day wholesale electricity prices jump ["by 140% to about $237 per megawatt hour."](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/wholesale-power-prices-spike-us-northeast-arctic-blast-arrives-2023-02-03/).  In 2020 the Millstone nuclear plant in Connecticut was kept in operation in part for a deal where the plant operator was guaranteed to sell half of its generation for [$49.99 per MWh](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/pdf/2020-R-0203.pdf).

- **Global Energy Consumption**.  BP's [Statistical Review of World Energy 2022] reported that global primary energy consumption was 595 exajoules (EJ), 31 EJ above 2020 and 8 EJ higher than the pre-COVID 2019 levels.

- **Utility Bills**.  Electricity customers are generally billed in cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).  Utility natural gas seems to be more varied: in Connecticut I was billed per "CCF" (hundred cubic feet).  In Nevada I am billed per "Therm" (100,000 BTU).   In Europe, natural gas is typicallyd billed per kWh.   In Australia, billing for gas is in megajoules (MJ).  Heating oil is sold in gallons. 

This is heavy.

### Energy and Power

A **joule** is the standard (SI) unit of **energy**, equivalent the work done by applying 1 Newton of force over 1 meter of distance.  A 500 mL single-serve bottole of Poland Spring water has a mass of 0.5 kg.  Gravity on the Earth's surface causes acceleration of ~10 $m/s^2$,[^1] so the weight of gravity applies about $0.5 kg \times 10 m / s^2 = 5 N$ of force on the bottle.  

[^1].  Actually $9.8 m/s^2$, but the math is simpler at 10. 

If I lift the bottle against the force of gravity to a height of 1 meter from the floor (stomach height for me), I have increased the bottle's gravitational potential energy by $5 N \times 1 m = 5 J$ of gravitational potential energy.  If I drop it, by the time it hits gthe ground it is moving with about 5 joules of kinetic energy.  If I do the same exercise at a height of 20 cm (~8 inches), the quantity of energy involved is 1 joule. 

**Power** is a rate of flow or transfer of energy, and is measured in quantity of energy per unit time.  A **watt** is the SI unit, defined as joules per second.   Lifting and dropping a liter bottle from a height of 1 meter once per second generates power at a rate of 5 watts.  If this could be harnessed with a cable, pulley and alternator system (this is the basic principle behind gravity based storage), for example, it theoretically would be enough power to light up the lightbulb on my night table.[^2]

[^2].  *What the hell is a gigawatt??*  It's 1 billion watts, about the power output from a large convential powerplant such as a nuclear, coal or natural gas plant.  Comparing this to dropping bottles of water?  A double decker Airbus A380 airplane has a mass of about half a million kilograms when full.   200 of these super-jumbo jets together represents 100 million kilograms, and raising them all one meter off the ground gives them $(100 \times 10^6 kg) \times 10m/s^2 \times 1 m = 10^9 J$ or 1 gigajoule of gravitational potential energy.  Dropping them to the ground over the course of 1 second converts that energy into kinetic energy at a rate of 1 GJ per second, a power rate of 1 gigawatt (GW).  Do that over and over again and you've got yourself a 1 gigawatt power plant.  Obviously, doing this with 242 planes gives you 1.21 gigawatts.

Taking this relationship backwards, a joule is the amount of energy delivered from one watt of power for one second; in other words, a joule equals 
one "watt second."  Since one hour is 3,600 seconds, a **watt hour** is 3,600 joules and the unit of consumption for residential electricity, a **kilowatt  hour (kWh)** is one thousand of those: 3,600,000 joules or 3.6 megajoules (MJ).

To compare some big numbers across markets. 
- The U.S. generates and consumes [about 4,000 TWh](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php) of electricity per year.   A terawatt hour is one billion kWh, so this is $(4,000 \times 10^9 kWh) \times (3.6 \times 10^6 J / kWh) = 1.44 \times 10^{19} J$.  $10^{18}$ gets a prefix "exa", so this is 14.4 exajoules (14.4 EJ). 
- So the U.S. **electricity consumption** alone (not including other uses of energy like heat and transportation) represents 2.3% of the 595 EJ of total global primary energy consumption in 2021.
- By contrast, the United State's broader total primary energy consumption in 2021 was 93 EJ, about 16% of global energy consumption.

That is energy.   How about power? 
- Simply dividing 4,000 TWh of annual electricity generation by $365 \times 24 = 8,760$ hours per year gives us an **average power** consumption of 0.46 terawatts or 456 GW.  According to the EIA, at the end of 2021 the U.S. had [1,144 GW total](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php) of utility-scale electricity generation capacity, or about 2.5x the average power consumption (this ratio makes sense given the significant deviations across hours of the day and seasons of electricity usage). 

#### Another Unit: BTU's

One more important unit of (thermal) energy, at least in the U.S., is the BTU (British Thermal Unit).  Originally conceived as the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by 1&deg;F, it is now defined as [~1,055 joules](https://www.britannica.com/science/British-thermal-unit).  A BTU is a small unit of energy practically speakin: a Therm (my residential billing unit for utility natural gas) is 100,000, and trading prices for natural gas in the U.S. are quoted in MMBTU, or millions of BTU. 

BTU's are a typical unit of sizing for air conditioning units in the U.S. (e.g., a window air conditioner might be a 10,000 BTU unit).   This measures the amount of heat energy transferred out of the space being cooled per hour (e.g., 10,000 BTU of heat energy removed per hour to cool a room).  Larger air conditioning units like central A/C are often measured in "tons", equivalent to 12,000 BTU, why not.[^3]

[^3].  It's called a "ton" because melting a ton of ice requires [286,000 BTU](https://davisac.com/blog/the-reason-air-conditioner-capacity-is-measured-in-tons#:~:text=Rounding%20up%2011%2C917%20Btu%2Fhr,ton%20of%20air%20conditioner%20capacity) of thermal energy: spread over 24 hours, this is about 12,000 BTU per hour of heat transfer.   That IS heavy.

### Thermal Energy vs. Electrical Energy

#### Heat Engines and Heat Rate

Another important concept is the difference in forms of energy.  Most relevant to energy markets are two kinds: thermal (heat) energy and electrical 
energy.  **Fuels** can be thought of as containing thermal energy (stored in chemical bonds and released through combustion).   These can be: 

(1) Combusted and the resulting heat consumed directly, as with utility natural gas burned in my home's furnace to heat my house; or 
(2) Combusted and the resulting heat used in a heat engine or turbine to convert the energy to electrical energy, as with natural gas burned in a power plant to heat another gas that drives a turbine which in turn generates electricity. 

Modern furnaces are very efficient, and in usage (1) above more than 95% of the thermal energy stored in natural gas, for example, can be captured to heat a home.  Converting heat energy to electrical energy via (2) results in lost energy due to the thermodynamic constraints of heat engines.[^4]

[^4].  Carnot's Theorem states that a heat engine operating between a hot temperature $T_H$ (measured against absolute zero) and a cold temperature $T_C$ cannot have efficiency exceeding ${T_H - T_C} \over T_H$.  

In practice, the efficiency of a power plant's conversion of thermal energy in fuel into electrical energy is quantified by the plant's **Heat Rate**.  Heat rate is [generally defined](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=107&t=3) as the number of BTU's of (thermal) energy input required to generate 1 kWh of electricity.   1 kWh is 3,412 BTU's, so all heat rates are higher than 3,412.  A heat rate of 6,800 has a 50% energy conversion efficiency: fuel with 6,800 BTU of thermal energy is needed to produce 3,400 kWh of electricity.  Efficient natural gas plants have heat rates in the [7,000 to 8,000 area](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_08_01.html), with coal plants around 10,000.
 
### Applications

#### Heating Bills 

Now we are equipped to resolve some of the disparate price quotations we have seen.  We'll begin with a simple one: the prices of natural gas, as used directly by consumers for thermal energy.  

A couple of points of reference: in the Las Vegas area, with mild winters, my family consumed 1,420 therms of gas in 2022, with about 72% of this coming in January, February, November and December.  A **therm** is 100,000 BTU, so my annual gas utility gas gost reflects 142 million BTU.  Converting this into kilowatt hours, that is $142 x 10^6 BTU \times 1~kWh / 3412~BTU = 41,620~kWh$ of thermal energy.  By contrast, my home used 30,314 kWh of electricity over the course of a year; this low ratio of gas to electricity usage makes intuitve sense in a warm climate where heating needs are limited and air-conditioning needs are high.   By way of comparison, the U.K. residential energy provider, Ofgem, [estimates](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/information-consumers/energy-advice-households/average-gas-and-electricity-use-explained) that a typical 4-5 person home consumes 17,000 kWh of natural gas in year, and 4,300 kWh of electricity in a year.

This gives me a better sense of what was happening in the market.   Compared to an average U.S. retail price price of electriicty of around [$0.14 per kWh in 2021](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=51438), an increase of $0.05 for the fuel cost of producing a kWh of electricity is a big enough (~30%) increase to catch media and politicians' attention.  But fuel prices up to &euro;0.75 in Europe are staggering and explain the extraordinary measures that European governments went to help citizens absorb these costs.
