I sometimes find it frustrating as a citizen and non-professional observer of energy markets to understand the quantities those markets deal in.  News and commentators quote prices in units that consumers may be unfamiliar with, making it difficult to intuit the importance of those prices.  Here are some examples: 

- **War in Ukraine**  After Russia invaded Ukraine, it cut off the bulk of its natural gas exports to Europe.  This resulted in wholesale natural gas prices (Dutch Title Transfer Facility or Dutch TTF) running from &euro;88 per MegaWatt hour (MWh) in February 2022 before the invastion, to a peak of &euro;340 per MWh in August 2022 when concerns about a shortage ran highest.   After conservation efforts, European countries securing liquefied natural gas imports, and a warmer-than-feared winter materialized, prices fell back to [&euro;76](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/business/europe-natural-gas-prices.html) [or lower](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sliding-natural-gas-prices-deal-surprise-reprieve-to-europe-11673005590) by the start of 2023.

- **U.S. Natural Gas Prices**.  Quoted in MMBTU (million british thermal units).  Often are in the $2 - 3 range, but driven by Ukraine-driven supply shocks, [briefly exceeded $9.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/natural-gas-prices-plunge-and-drillers-dial-back-236a2a9)

- **Something is Up in California**

- **French Nuclear Power**. After experiencing major maintenance issues earlier in the year, it was reported in December 2022 with significant relief that the French nuclear power plant fleet was generating above 40 GW of electricity for the [first time in 9 months(https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/french-nuclear-production-surpasses-40-gw-grid-operator-2022-12-11/)

- **New England Cold Snap**  In February 2023, New England faced a cold snap that saw next-day wholesale electricity prices jump ["by 140% to about $237 per megawatt hour."](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/wholesale-power-prices-spike-us-northeast-arctic-blast-arrives-2023-02-03/)

- **Economic Viability of Nuclear Plants**.  $49.99

- **Global Energy Consumption**.  BP's [Statistical Review of World Energy 2022] reported that global primary energy consumption was 595 exajoules (EJ), 31 EJ above 2020 and 8 EJ higher than the pre-COVID 2019 levels.

- **My Utility Bills**.  I pay [. ] cents per kilowatt hour for electricity.   To heat my house I pay for natural gas in [CCF] i think.
