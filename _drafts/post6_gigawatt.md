I sometimes find it frustrating as an observer of energy markets and policy to understand the quantities those markets deal in.  News and commentators quote prices in units that consumers may be unfamiliar with, making it difficult to intuit the importance of htose prices.  Here are some examples: 

- **War in Ukraine**  European wholesale natural gas prices (Dutch Title Transfer Facility or Dutch TTF) ran from &euro;88 per MegaWatt hour (MWh) in February 2022 before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, to a peak of &euro;340 per MWh in August 2022 when concerns about a shortage ran highest.   After conservation efforts, European countries securing liquefied natural gas imports, and a warmer-than-feared winter, prices fell back to [&euro;76](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/business/europe-natural-gas-prices.html) [or lower](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sliding-natural-gas-prices-deal-surprise-reprieve-to-europe-11673005590) by the start of 2023.

- **U.S. Natural Gas Prices**.  Quoted in MMBTU (million british thermal units).  Often are in the $2 - 3 range, but driven by Ukraine-driven supply shocks, [briefly exceeded $9.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/natural-gas-prices-plunge-and-drillers-dial-back-236a2a9).  In California, however, a pipeline closure limited supply and prices averaged [$19.40 per MMBTU in early January](https://www.wsj.com/articles/natural-gas-prices-have-fallen-back-to-earthexcept-in-california-11673411627) while the Henry Hub benchmark was under $4.00.  It's not clear how these compare to Eu

- **Cost of U.S. Nuclear**.  Millstone 49.99 per MWh.

- **French Nuclear Power** After experiencing major maintenance issues earlier in the year, it was reported in December 2022 with significant relief that the French nuclear power plant fleet was generating above 40 GW of electricity for the [first time in 9 months](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/french-nuclear-production-surpasses-40-gw-grid-operator-2022-12-11/)

- **Wholesale electricity**  In February 2023, New England faced a cold snap that saw next-day wholesale electricity prices jump ["by 140% to about $237 per megawatt hour."](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/wholesale-power-prices-spike-us-northeast-arctic-blast-arrives-2023-02-03/).  In 2020 the Millstone nuclear plant in Connecticut was kept in operation in part for a deal where the plant operator was guaranteed to sell half of its generation for [$49.99 per MWh](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/pdf/2020-R-0203.pdf).

- **Global Energy Consumption**.  BP's [Statistical Review of World Energy 2022] reported that global primary energy consumption was 595 exajoules (EJ), 31 EJ above 2020 and 8 EJ higher than the pre-COVID 2019 levels.

- **Utility Bills**.  Electricity customers are generally billed in cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).  Utility natural gas seems to be more varied: in Connecticut I was billed per "CCF" (hundred cubic feet).  In Nevada I am billed per "Therm" (100,000 BTU).   In Europe, natural gas is typicallyd billed per kWh.   In Australia, billing for gas is in megajoules (MJ).  Heating oil is sold in gallons. 

This is heavy.

### Energy and Power

A **joule** is the standard (SI) unit of **energy**, equivalent the work done by applying 1 Newton of force over 1 meter of distance.  A 500 mL single-serve bottole of Poland Spring water has a mass of 0.5 kg.  Gravity on the Earth's surface causes acceleration of ~10 m/s^2,[^1] so the weight of gravity applies about 0.5kg x 10 m / s^2 = 5 Newtons of force on the bottle.  

[^1].  Actually 9.8 m/s^2, but the math is simpler at 10. 

If I lift the bottle against the force of gravity to a height of 1 meter from the floor (stomach height for me), I have increased the bottle's gravitational potential energy by 5 N x 1 m = 5 joules of gravitational potential energy.  If I drop it, by the time it hits gthe ground it is moving with about 5 joules of kinetic energy.  If I do the same exercise at a height of 20 cm (~8 inches), the quantity of energy involved is 1 joule. 

**Power** is a rate of flow or transfer of energy, and is measured in quantity of energy per unit time.  A **watt** is the SI unit, defined as joules per second.   Lifting and dropping a liter bottle from a height of 1 meter once per second generates power at a rate of 5 watts.  If this could be harnessed with a cable, pulley and alternator system (this is the basic principle behind gravity based storage), for example, it theoretically would be enough power to light up the lightbulb on my night table.[^2]

[^2].  *What the hell is a gigawatt?*.  1 billion watts, or approximately the power output from a large convential powerplant such as a nuclear, coal or natural gas plant.  A double decker Airbus A380 has a mass of about half a million kilograms when full.   200 of these super-jumbo jets together represents 100 million kilograms, and raising them all one meter off the ground gives them 100 MM kg x 10m/s^2 * 1 m = 1 billion joules (1 gigajoule) of gravitational potential energy.  Dropping them to the ground over the course of 1 second converts that energy into kinetic energy at a rate of 1 GJ per second, a power rate of 1 gigawatt (GW).  Figure out how to do that over and over again and you've got yourself a 1 gigawatt power plant.  Doing this with 242 planes gives you 1.21 gigawatts!

Taking this relationship backwards, a joule is the amount of energy delivered from one watt of power for one second; in other words, a joule equals 
one "watt second."  Since one hour is 3,600 seconds, a **watt hour** is 3,600 joules and the unit of consumption for residential electricity, a **kilowatt  hour (kWh)** is one thousand of those: 3,600,000 joules or 3.6 megajoules (MJ).

To compare some big numbers across markets. 
- The U.S. generates and consumes [about 4,000 TWh](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php) of electricity per year.   A terawatt hour is one billion kWh, so this is (4,000 x 10^9 kWh) x (3.6 x 10^6 J / kWh) = 1.44 x 10^19 J.  10^18 gets a prefix "exa", so this is 14.4 exajoules (14.4 EJ). 
- So the U.S. **electricity consumption** alone (not including other uses of energy like heat and transportation) represents 2.3% of the 595 EJ of total global primary energy consumption in 2021.
- By contrast, the United State's broader total primary energy consumption in 2021 was 93 EJ, about 16% of global energy consumption.

That is energy.   How about power? 
- Simply dividing 4,000 TWh of annual electricity generation by 365 x 24 = 8,760 hours per year gives us an **average power** consumption of 0.46 terawatts or 456 GW.
