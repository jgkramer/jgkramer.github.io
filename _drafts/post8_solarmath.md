Nerd alert.  This post is intended to explore the physical underpinnings of the graph below, showing the maximum utility solar electricity generation in Nevada by hour of the day, for each month.

Two features of this data are unintuitive: 

1.  The "dip" in mid-day in winter months.  The best solar generation does not occur when the sun is highest in the sky at mid-day, but in two peaks -- before and after.

2.  Long hours of consistently high output in summer.  Of the roughly 14 hours per day of production in June, 10 of those are at least 90% of the peak: the intensity drops off only during the two hours after sunrise and two hours before sunset.
