## Data Source: EIA

Data in this post comes from the Energy Information Administration website; in particular, its Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, which
provides hour-granularity by region (defined by the electric grid balancing authority serving that region) on a number of variables.
These include total usage and generation in the region (balanced by import / export from neighboring regions), as well as a detailed look
at generation by type of source (e.g., coal, nuclear, natural gas, solar, wind).  An example of this latter chart is shown below.
