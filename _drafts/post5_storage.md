Electricity storage systems (batteries, pumped hydro storage) transport electricity through time, from generation earlier to consumption later. 
Generally speaking, storage is valuable when the aggregate amount of electricity generated is adequate to satisfy aggregate demand, but there is a 
mismatch in the timing of supply and demand.  Some basic fact patterns are: 

- **Supply More Variable Demand**.  As discussed in previous posts, there is both a daily and a seasonal cycle to electricity usage.  If a region's generation is dominated by traditional base-load type power plants with high and constant generation capacity (coal, nuclear), there are two basic choices for meeting demand: either have enough generation capacity to cover the peak usage, or marry sub-peak generation with the ability to store energy when demand is low and use it when demand exceeds capacity.  
- **Demand More Variable through time than Supply**.  It is also possible for supply to cycle above and below demand.  Solar power, for example, generates electricity only during a 8-14 hour period during the daytime and none at night.  A grid with significant solar power may need storage

In both of these situations there will be a cost question of whether it is more economic to 


- **Unplanned Intermittancy**.  


In either case
