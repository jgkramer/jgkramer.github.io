Electricity storage systems (batteries, pumped hydro storage) transport electricity through time, from generation earlier to consumption later. 
Generally speaking, storage is valuable when the aggregate amount of electricity generated is adequate to satisfy aggregate demand, but there is a 
mismatch in the timing of supply and demand.  Some basic fact patterns are: 

- **Supply More Variable Demand**.  As discussed in previous posts, there is both a daily and a seasonal cycle to electricity usage.  If a region's generation is dominated by traditional base-load type power plants with high and constant generation capacity (coal, nuclear) or are quickly dispatchable (e.g., natural gas), there are two basic choices for meeting demand: either have enough generation capacity to cover the peak usage, or marry sub-peak generation with the ability to store energy when demand is low and use it when demand exceeds capacity.  
- **Demand More Variable through time than Supply**.  It is also possible for supply to cycle above and below demand.  Solar power, for example, generates electricity only during a 8-14 hour period during the daytime and none at night.  A grid with significant solar power may need storage
- **Unplanned Intermittancy**.  Power outages due to storms or maintenance issues, or merely unfavorable weather conditions such as low-wind and low-sun [dunkefulflaute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkelflaute) may mean there is less generation capacity than planned for.   

In all of these situations there will be a question of whether it is more efficient to invest in storage or more (non-intermittent) generation capacity to compensate; this question is beyond the scope of this post.  

This post will attempt to illustrate, using reasonably realistic electricity demand models and overly simplistic supply models (with no unplanned outages) what profile of storage could be useful: how much energy capacity is needed and how frequently it cycles.
