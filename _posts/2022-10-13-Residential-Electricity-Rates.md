This will be the first of a sequence of posts exploring the structure of residential electricity rates in the U.S.  
The project was inspired by a conversation I had with a friend of mine who lives near San Diego, California.  Owning an electric vehicle,
he was keenly aware of the cost of using electricity (in cents per kWh) at different times of the day 
(he also sensibly only turned on the air conditioning in his house after 9pm). 

This conversation made me realize that I could learn a lot more, both about my own expenses but also how the system works
