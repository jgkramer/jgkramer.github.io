#### Storage

- Day to day storage - daily peak / trough vs. average 
    Kramers: it's about ~25 kWh (vs. average)
    - EIA could also provide solar generation capacity...but maybe this is too political? also somewhat speculative
 
- Comparison vs. Alternate Input
 
- Season to season
- Outage

- Electricity Storage

Pumped Storage Hydro: 43 PSH plants with a total power capacity of 21.9 GW and estimated energy storage capacity of 553 GWh accounted for 93% of utility-scale storage power capacity (GW) and more than 99% of electrical energy storage (GWh).

EIA: Battery Storage

As of October 2022, 7.8 GW (not GWH!) of POWER capacity, with plans for 30GW in the next few years.
