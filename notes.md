#### Paper concluding that "Tiered" pricing was not effective.

#### Storage

- Day to day storage - daily peak / trough vs. average 
    Kramers: it's about ~25 kWh (vs. average)
    - EIA could also provide solar generation capacity...but maybe this is too political? also somewhat speculative
 
- Comparison vs. Alternate Input
 
- Season to season
- Outage

- Electricity Storage

Pumped Storage Hydro: 43 PSH plants with a total power capacity of 21.9 GW and estimated energy storage capacity of 553 GWh accounted for 93% of utility-scale storage power capacity (GW) and more than 99% of electrical energy storage (GWh).

EIA: Battery Storage

As of October 2022, 7.8 GW (not GWH!) of POWER capacity, with plans for 30GW in the next few years. 
https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=54939

This post shows that battery storage energy capacity is typically < 2 hours worth of power.

Purposes of Battery Storage: 
(1) Price Abitrage
(2) Firm capacity / peaking capacity
(3) Demand management (shorter ramp up / down times).

### Solar

#### Daily Cycle of Natural Gas

In Nevada, where there is no nuclear baseload and a lot of solar, gas is INVERSE to solar generation to fill gaps. 
--> can use nuclear to swap out the minimum gas usage.  if you add solar, 

In North Carolina (Duke East), where there is a big nuclear baseload, and solar is a smaller fraction, the natural gas spike is in the evening -- 
natural gas + solar need to join forces to meet peak evening demand.
