#### Paper concluding that "Tiered" pricing was not effective.

#### Storage

- Day to day storage - daily peak / trough vs. average 
    Kramers: it's about ~25 kWh (vs. average)
    - EIA could also provide solar generation capacity...but maybe this is too political? also somewhat speculative
 
- Comparison vs. Alternate Input
 
- Season to season
- Outage

- Electricity Storage

Pumped Storage Hydro: 43 PSH plants with a total power capacity of 21.9 GW and estimated energy storage capacity of 553 GWh accounted for 93% of utility-scale storage power capacity (GW) and more than 99% of electrical energy storage (GWh).

EIA: Battery Storage

As of October 2022, 7.8 GW (not GWH!) of POWER capacity, with plans for 30GW in the next few years.

This post shows that battery storage energy capacity is typically < 2 hours worth of power.

Purposes of Battery Storage: 
(1) Price Abitrage
(2) Firm capacity / peaking capacity
(3) Demand management (shorter ramp up / down times).

### Solar

#### Daily Cycle of Natural Gas

In Nevada, where there is no nuclear baseload and a lot of solar, gas is INVERSE to solar generation to fill gaps. 
--> can use nuclear to swap out the minimum gas usage.  if you add solar, 

In North Carolina (Duke East), where there is a big nuclear baseload, and solar is a smaller fraction, the natural gas spike is in the evening -- 
natural gas + solar need to join forces to meet peak evening demand.   


### A Word on Power Cycling and Economic Feasibility

Whether that kind of tradeoff is economical may depend on how much the battery gets used: in the 1.86x example above, the benefit of 18 days of batter usage may not justify the capital cost of a 3 GWh storage project (i.e., capital cost savings of 700 MWh less generation may not compensate).  Further economic justification for the capital cost of the storage project can come from using it more frequently in non-peak times **if** it results in fuel savings costs.   
    
Fuel savings costs through the use of storage cannot come from reduction in aggregate fuel usage: electricity that is delivered from storage at peak usage time must have been generated by a power plant at an earlier time.   In fact, if grid electricity is stored, generally only [80% of the energy input](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46756) can be retrieved later.  
    
Economizing can only arise if time-shifting allows the grid to replace genreation from high-cost sources at peak times (e.g., petroleum or less efficient natural gas plants on the right of the supply curve) with lower-cost sources at off-peak times (e.g., nuclear, coal or solar on the left side of the supply curve).
