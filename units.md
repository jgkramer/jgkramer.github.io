#### Units of Energy

| Watts | Joules | Explanation | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 W s | 1 J | definition |
| 1 W h | 3.6 kJ | 3600 s / h |
| 1 kW h | 3.6 MJ | |
| 1 MW h | 3.6 GJ | |
| 1 GW h | 3.6 TJ | | 

#### BTUs

1 BTU = 1.055 kJ

1 kWh = (3600 kJ / kWh) (1 BTU / 1.055 kH) = 3400 BTU 

#### Therms 

Natural gas

1 Therm = 10^5 BTU natural gas
1 Decatherm = 10^6 BTU
1 Therm amount of energy in ~100 cubic feet (1 ccf). 

#### Heat Rate (Natural Gas)

Heat rate = energy content of fuel (usually in BTU) needed to generate 1 kWh of electricity (=3400 BTU). 

Heat Rate Example: 
Heat rate of a natural gas plant can be ~8,000 BTU gas / kWh of electricity. 
Conversion Efficiency = 1 kWh elecricity / 8000 BTU gas * (3400 BTU elec / 1 kWh elec) = 3400 BTU elec / 8000 BTU gas = 42.5% efficiency

Price Example:
$4.00 / MM BTU gas price * (1 MMBTU / 10^6 BTU) * (8,000,000 BTU gas / MWh elec heat rate) =  $32 / MWh Electricity.   $0.032 / kWh electricity.
